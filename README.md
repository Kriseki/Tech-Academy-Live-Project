# Tech-Academy-Live-Project
Final project from the Tech Academy

This is a web app being developed by the Tech Academy students during our last weeks. Made to make employers and student connection easier and have a central location for career information for students.

A few aspects of the application I worked on were:

Order the bulletin posts by most recent post (JPBulletinsController line 59)

Add new class to table headers to make them gray (JPStudentRundown Index)

Add JavaScript function so when the "email students" button is pressed the user is prompted to select whether they are emailing in regards to graduating or applying. Once selected the user's email client will open with a default body message. (JPStudentRundown Index line 202)

Add space between the text editor buttons and the text box in JPBulletin Create view (style.css line 4238)

Removed the Home, Blog, and Contact buttons from the navbar (layout line 56)

Make search bar and buttons inline with each other in JPStudentRundown Index (style.css line 3705)

Remove "Please log-in" error message from Login view and display on Create page of JPStudents controller (JPStudents Create line 8)

Change a tags from gray to orange (style.css line 43)
